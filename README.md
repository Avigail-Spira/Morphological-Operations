# Morphological-Operations

The four morphological operations which are included in this program are:
1. Opening
2. Closing
3. Erosion
4. Dilation

These are done to remove "salt" and "pepper" from the given image. Opening removes background noise while also removing some of the object itself. Closing does the opposite; it fills in the salt in the object but stratches the object out in each direction as well. Erosion and Dilation do both opening and closing and fix some of the problems that come up when opening and closing are done on their own. 

This project performs each of these operations and outputs the new images in the output files.
